For this blog i am going to talk about how to create a simple blog page with vue client,
After install node.js, we can create vue client in webpack-simple by typingthe follwoing
commmand line in the console:

$ vue init wekpack-simple my-first-blog

register a new vue addBlog to our app.vue by placing

components:{
	'add-blog':addBlog
}

to our export default part. This is the f
